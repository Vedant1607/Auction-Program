# Bidding Program

This Python script allows multiple users to enter bids for an item, and at the end, it determines and displays the highest bidder.

## Features

- Accepts bids from multiple users.
- Determines the highest bid and declares the winner.
- Provides a clear screen (simulated by printing new lines) after each bidder to maintain privacy.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

## Usage
1. Run the script: Execute the script in your terminal or your Python environment.
2. Enter your name: The program will prompt each bidder to enter their name.
3. Enter your bid: The program will then ask for your bid amount.
4. Continue bidding: After each bid, the program will ask if there are more bidders. If there are, the screen will clear (simulated by printing new lines) for the next bidder.
5. Declare the winner: When no more bidders are left, the program will find and announce the highest bidder.
